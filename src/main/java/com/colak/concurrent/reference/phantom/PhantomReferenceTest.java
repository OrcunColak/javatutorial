 * The difference between WeakReference and SoftReference is that the Garbage collector can collect an object if only
 * weak references are pointing to it i.e., a weak reference is eagerly collected.
 * <p>
 * On the other hand, objects with Soft Reference are only collected when the JVM absolutely needs memory.
 * <p>
 * A phantom reference is a type of reference that allows you to monitor an objectâ€™s finalization (cleanup) by the garbage collector,
 * but it does not provide direct access to the referenced object.
